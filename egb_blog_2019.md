**Problem Set Help and Update**

First, one of the codes for labor compensation was discontinued in 2016. Be sure to use the updated code here:

- "A033RC1A027NBEA" called "National income: Compensation of employees"

This ends in 2017, so do it up to that point.

Wait...but I don't know how to use FRED. In the back of the slides [here](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/EGB/raw/master/materials/measurement/week1.measurement_egb.pdf) there are notes on how to use FRED.

Ok, how do I compute growth rates? In this class, I prefer to use continuously compounded growth rates for many reasons. They are explained in this handout here:

  - [Notes on Computing Growth Rates](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/EGB/raw/master/materials/measurement/notes_growth_rates.pdf)

How do I learn more about the questions in this problem set?

- [Changes in real interest rates](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/07/14/decline-long-term-interest-rates)

Here is a break down of National Income (GDP) by where it comes from:

**First week...**

Great job guys. So we started off by asking some big questions---specifically **"what is economic growth?"** Through our discussion we got around to four ideas:

- It's something about our capacity to more produce stuff.

- It's something about earning more income, be it from working or investments.

- It's something about being able to buy more goods and services.

- And it tells us something about quality of life, but not everything.

This work was awesome. And then the first three bullet points lead us to talk about GDP---which literally is a measure of how much we can produce (first bullet), but those making the production happen to receive income for their effort (second bullet), and we are able to spend that income on goods and services (third bullet). And enjoying goods and services in not what life is about, but does provide us with satisfaction (last bullet). So GDP is an all encompassing measure that picks up these ideas we started out with.

Next week: Seeing how it works in a semi-complicated economy, measures of employment. The production function.

**The 2018/2019 Global Economy in a nutshell**

This course is about global macroeconomics and the goal is that you can systematically think about macroeconomic events, evaluate them, and make informed decisions for your business, operating unit, life, etc.

Ok, so what is the current situation? This is probably the most complex situation that I have experienced in my lifetime. The good news: economic growth in the US has been booming in a way we have not seen for nearly 15 years. The bad news: there is tremendous uncertainty about many issues that complicate our understating about the path forward.  Let me put these uncertain/outstanding issues in the context of things we will discuss:

1. **Why is the US booming? Is it sustainable? Economic growth in China is slowing, why?** The first third of this course focuses on sources of economic growth gives us tools to understand these issues and think about where we have been and where the economy is going.

2. **Trade wars. What's the issue? What's stake?** Globalization has been under sustained attack over the past several years (and not just in the US, see Brexit). This has complicated the economic outlook. The second third of the course focuses on understating the motivation for international trade and why there are valid concerns about trade. FYI: this is something I'm an active researcher in [see this summary of some of it.](http://www.waugheconomics.com/uploads/2/2/5/6/22563786/ntd_lw_tax.pdf)   

3. **What will the FED do in 2019? Will the FED continue to raise interest rates? Will we go into a recession?** Amongst market commentators (and our President) what the FED will do in 2019 is of great interest. The final third of the course focuses on understanding how the nominal side of the economy interacts with the real side, what role the FED plays, and how it might be able to prevent (cause?) a recession. By the last day of the course, you should be able to lecture your parents on FED policy.

Awesome right? One final thought. Economics is not a boring subject, far from it. You can not open a newspaper (web-browser) without seeing economics on the front page. So it helps all of us if we keep up with the news and current economic events.

Where can I start? Here are some places that I will focus on over the semester.

- As a STERN student, you should have free access to the FT. This is an amazing resource to take advantage of. On the FT, there is an economic commentator [Gavyn Davies](https://www.ft.com/gavyn-davies) who provides nice, market oriented economic commentary (backed up by his hedge funds macro forecasts). See his [round up of 2018 here.](https://www.ft.com/content/2c4af54a-fbe0-11e8-aebf-99e208d3e521)

- This is a FAV of Stern Economics. It's the [econsnapshot](https://www.econsnapshot.com/) a website ran by the former Dean of Stern Tom Cooley and friends. It provides nice graphics of the current state of the US economy and [Europe](https://europeansnapshot.com/).

- I also like the [real time economics blog](https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/) in the WSJ. You have to pay. When something great comes up, I'll circulate it.  

- Finally [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/) is great. Ask your parents to get you a subscription for your birthday.

**Welcome to The Economics of Global Business!**

Soon we will have our first meeting and get the semester started. I want to reach out to you about some features of this course to help you prepare for the semester ahead.

**Read the [Syllabus](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/EGB/raw/master/materials/syllabus/syllabus_waugh_egb_spring_2019.pdf).** I've posted a preliminary version of the syllabus for the upcoming semester. This has information about important dates, texts, grading, etc. Please take some time to go over this prior to our first class meeting.

**[Take the online survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdpE_eI2_znxkrBR9s_3rZB_Ky4JZIc_p4pNKzj7iLYciU79Q/viewform?usp=sf_link).** This [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdpE_eI2_znxkrBR9s_3rZB_Ky4JZIc_p4pNKzj7iLYciU79Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) has the survey for you to complete. As the syllabus details, there will be a bunch of online quizzes throughout the semester. This is the first one. It just asks questions about your background and as long as you complete it, you'll receive full credit. And you have until Jan 31st to complete it---so no rush if your still on vacation!

**Explore the [website](https://mwaugh0328.github.io/EGB/).** I've the designed website to provide a bunch of information about the course in a simple way. In particular, the main week by week guide of the course.

I'm looking forward to meeting you all and a great Spring semester!
