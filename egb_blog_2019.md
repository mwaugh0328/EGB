**The 2018/2019 Global Economy in a nutshell**

This course is about global macroeconomics and the goal is that you can systematically think about macroeconomic events, evaluate them, and make informed decisions for your business, operating unit, life, etc.

Ok, so what is the current situation? This is probably the most complex situation that I have experienced in my lifetime. The good news: economic growth in the US has been booming in a way we have not seen for nearly 15 years. The bad news: there is tremendous uncertainty about many issues that complicate our understating about the path forward.  Let me put these uncertain/outstanding issues in the context of things we will discuss:

1. **Why is the US booming? Is it sustainable? Economic growth in China is slowing, why?** The first third of this course focuses on sources of economic growth gives us tools to understand these issues and think about where we have been and where the economy is going.

2. **Trade wars. What's the issue? What's stake?** Globalization has been under sustained attack over the past several years (and not just in the US, see Brexit). This has complicated the economic outlook. The second third of the course focuses on understating the motivation for international trade and why there are valid concerns about trade. FYI: this is something I'm an active researcher in [see this summary of some of it.](http://www.waugheconomics.com/uploads/2/2/5/6/22563786/ntd_lw_tax.pdf)   

3. **What will the FED do in 2019? Will the FED continue to raise interest rates? Will we go into a recession?** Amongst market commentators (and our President) what the FED will do in 2019 is of great interest. The final third of the course focuses on understanding how the nominal side of the economy interacts with the real side, what role the FED plays, and how it might be able to prevent (cause?) a recession. By the last day of the course, you should be able to lecture your parents on FED policy.

Awesome right? One final thought. Economics is not a boring subject, far from it. You can not open a newspaper (web-browser) without seeing economics on the front page. So it helps all of us if we keep up with the news and current economic events.

Where can I start? Here are some places that I will focus on over the semester.

- As a STERN student, you should have free access to the FT. This is an amazing resource to take advantage of. On the FT, there is an economic commentator [Gavyn Davies](https://www.ft.com/gavyn-davies) who provides nice, market oriented economic commentary (backed up by his hedge funds macro forecasts). See his [round up of 2018 here.](https://www.ft.com/content/2c4af54a-fbe0-11e8-aebf-99e208d3e521)

- This is a FAV of Stern Economics. It's the [econsnapshot](https://www.econsnapshot.com/) a website ran by the former Dean of Stern Tom Cooley and friends. It provides nice graphics of the current state of the US economy and [Europe](https://europeansnapshot.com/).

- I also like the [real time economics blog](https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/) in the WSJ. You have to pay. When something great comes up, I'll circulate it.  

- Finally [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/) is great. Ask your parents to get you a subscription for your birthday.
