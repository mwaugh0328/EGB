%\begin{itemize}
%\medskip
%\item Need a common vocabulary

\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{GDP}
\begin{itemize}
\item GDP = Gross Domestic Product
\bigskip
\item GDP = the market value of final goods and services newly produced within a nation during a fixed period of time.
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item \textbf{Market value }(it allows to add up different products, but misses home production; black economy; non-traded government services)
\medskip
\item \textbf{New goods} (i.e., not second-hand exchanges)
\medskip
\item \textbf{Within a nation}: domestic location (not citizenship)
\medskip
\item A measure of \textbf{final} goods and services (why? See next slide)
\medskip
\item \textbf{Gross} of depreciation, i.e., it does not embody capital consumption due to wear and tear (Example: reduction in value of a car used by a taxi company)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Three Ways to Compute GDP}
How to compute GDP:
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item GDP = Value added: Sales minus material input costs (intermediate inputs).
\bigskip
\item GDP = Income: Payments to labor and capital (profits, rental income).
\bigskip
\item GDP = Expenditure: Purchases of final goods and services, including exports minus imports
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{GDP as Value Added}
\begin{itemize}
\item Value added $=$ sales $-$ material input costs
\bigskip
\item Example
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item Farmer produces wheat, sells it for 100
\medskip
\item Miller buys wheat, produces flour, sells it for 175
\medskip
\item Baker buys flour, makes bread, sells it for 300
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
\item What is value added for each producer?
\bigskip
\item What is GDP?
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Intermediate vs Final Goods}
\begin{itemize}
\item Why not sum over all goods?
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item TO AVOID DOUBLE COUNTING!
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
\item Another example:
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item Goodrich Corporation manufactures and sells components and systems for aircraft. Say that it produces just one system per year for Boeing, worth \$10M.
\medskip
\item Boeing buys the system for its 787 aircraft; total value of the airplane is \$80M.
\medskip
\item The landing system produced by Goodrich is included in the \$80M! The value of the final good (the airplane) includes the value of the intermediate parts (engines, frame,  navigation system, etc.)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
\end{frame}

\begin{itemize}
\item GDP = payments to labor and capital
\bigskip
\item In income but not in GDP
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item Capital gains
\medskip
\item Interest on government debt
\medskip
\item Net foreign income
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
\item In GDP but not in income
\begin{itemize}
\medskip

\frametitle{GDP as Final Sales}
\begin{itemize}
\item GDP = purchases of final goods and services, including exports minus imports
\bigskip
\item Final goods/service purchases broken down in the following way\ldots\\
\medskip
GDP = C + I + G + NX.
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item C = final sales new goods to households, ``consumption''
\medskip
\item I = final sales of new capital goods to firms, ``investment''
\medskip
\item G = purchases of new goods and services by government
\medskip
\item NX = net exports, exports - imports
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\frametitle{More on Consumption, Investment, etc.}
\begin{itemize}
\item C = final sales new goods to households, ``consumption''
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item Includes, things like durable (i.e. long lasting) goods, nondurables, services.
\end{itemize}
\medskip
\item I = final sales of new capital goods to firms, ``investment''
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item That is a physical asset used by firms in future production.
\medskip
\item Includes: Firms spending on plant and equipment, residential spending by consumers and landlords on housing, change firms inventories
\end{itemize}
\medskip
\item G = purchases of new goods and services by government
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item Does NOT include transfer payments (i.e. food stamps/unemploymen insurance).

\frametitle{Problems in Measuring GDP}
\begin{itemize}
\item How to measure government services?
\begin{itemize}
\smallskip
\item Valued at cost, i.e. use the second approach (income side) to measure GDP.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
\item Ignores household production
\bigskip
\item Ignores intangible investment
\bigskip
\item Ignores ``underground'' economy
\bigskip
\item Environment/Pollution
\bigskip
\item Separate point --- the formula $Y = C+I+G+NX$ says nothing about causality.

\frametitle{GDP Price Deflator vs CPI}
Three key conceptual differences\ldots
\begin{itemize}
\item GDP price deflator measures changes in prices for entire economy.\\
    \medskip
     CPI only measures prices of goods and services bought by consumers.
\bigskip
\item GDP price deflator only measures changes in prices for domestic production. International effects are netted out.\\
    \medskip
    CPI includes both domestically and imported goods.
\bigskip
\item More subtle. They are different types of price indexes. \\
    \medskip
GDP price deflator, the basket of goods can change. It will not completely reflect the costs of higher prices. \\
    \medskip
CPI fixes the basket, but prices change. It will not reflect substitution effects as relative prices change.

%\item Bill Easterly, WSJ, March 2007:
%\begin{itemize}
%\medskip
%\item Bill Gates expressed indifference to Africa's stagnant GDP, since ``you can't eat GDP.'' \ldots \\
%    \medskip
%    \textbf{Mr. Gates apparently missed the economics class that listed the components of GDP, such as food.}

%%\note<1>{\color{granata}\scriptsize GDP, as you have read in the notes, is
%%total value added by residents in a given country. We always think of it as an
%%accurate measure of well-being. Is that so? For sure, well-being is a complex
%%concepts, with many facets. In other words, there are many indicators of well
%%being. How does GDP correlate with them?\\}
%%
%%\note<2>{\color{granata}\scriptsize Life expectancy at birth is nothing but
%%the number of years a new-born is expected to live in a given country. As we
%%can see, it has a strong positive correlation with GDP. There are some
%%outliers, however. The two outliers which have expectancy=50 are South Africa
%%and Equatorial Guinea. \color{blue} For the actual data needed to describe the
%%outliers, refer to the folder in the drawer, or to the web.\\}
%%
%%\note<3>{\color{granata}\scriptsize Issues that should come up here:
%%distribution of income/wealth is very skewed in most developing countries.\\}
%%
%%\note<4>{\color{blue}\scriptsize \color{granata} Talk about Correlation Vs.
%%Causation. Many people think of a causation from GDP to life expectancy. Is it
%%that clear? Any way, the issue to clarify is that: no causation can be
%%inferred from the picture. The figure only outlines a correlation.\\}
