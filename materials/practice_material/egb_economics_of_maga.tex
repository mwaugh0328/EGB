Simple question: What are the economic consequences of a tax cut?  Donald J. Trump's presidential platform outlines a substantial tax decrease by reducing tax rates for a large majority of Americans. This tax reduction will be off-set by a substantial reduction in government spending. \textbf{That is Trump's tax plan is deficit neutral.}

\begin{itemize}
\item How would Trump's tax plan affect real GDP?

\item What would be the impact of Trump's tax plan on investment and the real interest rate?

\item How would Trump's tax plan change aggregate consumption? Does this allow us to ``buy more stuff''? Why or why not?

\item The way to think about investments is that they are purchase of capital goods are used in the future for production, i.e. more $I$ leads to more $K$ down the road. What is your prediction for real GDP in the future? Why?

\end{itemize}
