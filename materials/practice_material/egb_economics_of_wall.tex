Simple question: What are the economic consequences of a ``wall''? Good, bad, who knows? Let's simplify this a bit: \textbf{The WALL reduces the number of people working in the United States, so less $L$.} Let's use the framework developed in class to answer the following questions.

\begin{itemize}
\item How would the wall affect aggregate, real GDP? What is the ``core principle'' behind your answer.

\item How would this affect the real wages.  What is the ``core principle'' behind the production function that drives this? 

\item Is there a conflict between the two answers above?

\item If you received most of your income from capital rather than labor, is the wall in your economic interest? (Hint: how would the wall affect real interest rates?)

\end{itemize}
