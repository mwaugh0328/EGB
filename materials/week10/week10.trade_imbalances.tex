\begin{itemize}
\item In an open economy
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item spending need not equal output
\medskip
\item saving need not equal investment
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
\item Think about your economic life\ldots
\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item Does your spending equal your income?
\medskip
\item What does it imply when it does not? Saver? Borrower?
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\medskip
\item C $=$ consumer demand for goods and services

\item I $=$ demand for investment goods.
\medskip
\item G $=$ government demand for goods and services

\frametitle{Savings, Investment, Net Exports I}
Recall\ldots
\begin{eqnarray*}
Y = C + I +  G + NX.
\end{eqnarray*}
Then rearranging \ldots
\begin{eqnarray*}
\small S &= \underbrace{Y - C}_{\small \mbox{Private \ Savings}} \ \ \ \ - \underbrace{\bar G}_{\small \mbox{Public\ Savings}} \\
\\
\\
&= I + NX
\end{eqnarray*}

\frametitle{Savings, Investment, Net Exports II}
Then rearranging again\ldots
\begin{eqnarray*}
\small S - I = \underbrace{NX}_{\small \mbox{international borrowing/lending}}
\end{eqnarray*}\\
\bigskip
Think about if net exports are positve\ldots
\begin{itemize}
\smallskip
\item Selling more goods than buying\ldots how is this possible\ldots Then you must be a net \textbf{lender} to the rest of the world.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
If net exports are negative\ldots
\begin{itemize}
\smallskip
\item Buying more goods than selling\ldots how is this possible\ldots Then you must be a net \textbf{borrowing} from the rest of the world.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Savings, Investment, Net Exports III}
Then rearranging again\ldots
\begin{eqnarray*}
\small S - I = \underbrace{NX}_{\small \mbox{Trade Balance}}
\end{eqnarray*}\\
\bigskip
Key point\ldots
\begin{itemize}
\smallskip
\item Trade balance tells us about net international capital flows.
\medskip
\item If running a trade deficit, then this implies a country is a net borrower!!!!

\end{eqnarray*}
\item Consumption
\begin{eqnarray*}
C = \beta \times (Y - T), \quad \mbox{where} \quad \beta \in (0,1).
\end{eqnarray*}
\item Investment function is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
I = I(r)
\end{eqnarray*}
\item Government policy
\begin{eqnarray*}
G = \bar G \ \ \ \ T = \bar T

\frametitle{Assumptions about capital flows}
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] Domestic \& foreign assets are perfect substitutes (same risk, maturity, etc.)

\item[2.]  Perfect capital mobility: No restrictions on international trade in assets

\item[3.]  Economy is small: \\
Cannot affect the world interest rate, denoted $r^*$
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
$1.$ and $2.$ imply that domestic $r = r^*$ always.\\
\bigskip
$3.$ implies actions in home economy do not affect $r^*$.
